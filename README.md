This repository contains Douglas Wade Goodall's MultiWare Framework.

It is an example of Doug's work as a software engineer and is demonstrative
of the code quality he would produce while working for others.

This project contains a number of handy classes providing valuable
support for application features useful for implementation and
debugging.

"html" class that generates static web pages.

"metainfo" class that explores the c++ Standard Preprocessor Macros.

"multiware" class that provides function level debugging aid with log
and web page creation tools. Much more elegant than printf debugging.

"shared" class with CTOR that opens/creates a shared memory region
and some member functions for examining the shared region.

This is a Copyrighted work and is presented for evaluation only.

Should you desire to use it for your own purposes, please contact
Doug and arrange matters.
